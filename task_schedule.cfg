# Define task parameters
#  cron: Job repetition specification ala crontab
#  exec: Name of executable.  Can have $ENV{} vars which get interpolated.
#        If bin_dir is defined then bin_dir is prepended to non-absolute exec names.
#  log: Name of log.  Can have $ENV{} vars which get interpolated.
#        If log is set to '' then no log file will be created
#        If log is not defined it is set to <task_name>.log.
#        If log_dir is defined then log_dir is prepended to non-absolute log names.
#  timeout: Maximum time (seconds) for job before timing out

# This has multiple jobs which get run in specified order
# Note the syntax 'exec <number> : cmd', which means that the given command is
# executed only once for each <number> of times the task is executed.  In the
# example below, the commands are done once each 1, 2, and 4 minutes, respectively.
